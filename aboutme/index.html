    <h2>Madeline Dantzscher</h2>
    <p>Hello there, I'm Madeline Dantzscher. I live in Florida with my husband and two sons.
        We love being outdoors, whether going to the beach, walking through the woods, or swimming in the springs, we are in for a good time.
        I have been working on my degree off and on since having kids. Recently changed my major to software development and am excited to learn.
        I am currently a stay at home mom while my boys are little but am interested in making a career out of software development.</p>
